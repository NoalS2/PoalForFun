# PoalForFun
A project to work on with Paige for fun.

# Noal Project Ideas

Simply a quick brainstorm of things I think I could find fun.

1. Instructional base code to teach algorithms.
2. A visual representation of a cool recursive solution for educational purposes.
3. An introduction to coding concepts, data structures, and algorithms for friends and family of computer scientists. 
4. A puzzle "game" where you balance trees given certain operations. 

I was just brainstorming some ideas that I think could be fun to work on together. For some reason they are all like, teaching coding concepts type projects because I guess that's where my brain is at tonight. But I don't really know what I think would be fun to work on, I just think it would be fun to work on something with you. But also I know you program literally all day for work so there may only be very specific kinds of personal projects that you would actually enjoy to work on in your free time. Anyway I did not spend too long thinking about this list so don't feel like if we did work on something it would need to be on their, I was just throwing out ideas for fun.

# Paige Project Ideas

Made a new section so I don't mess with yours :) This is also just brainstorming

- Visualize sorting algorithms
- Procedurally generated environments (I saw a video about making a minecraft clone in C in a day) see also: [perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise#Algorithm_detail)
- Simulation stuff: like heat dissipation or the laplace wave equation
- Physics simulation?
- Machine learning: OpenAI gym or something?
- We could make a cryptocurrency lol

# What Language?
Honestly I *really* don't want to use something dynamically typed like Python or Javascript. If we want to focus on the *project* rather than the language, I'd recommend Java or Kotlin. (Or maybe C++? I know you don't have as much experience with it, but I might know it enough to fill in the gaps?)

- Java
- C++
- Kotlin: Compiles to JVM, less verbose syntax than Java, strong functional influence
- Nim: looks elegant, lightweight. Like that it compiles to C
- OCaml: functional, good syntax. See [code examples](https://ocaml.org/learn/taste.html)
- Ada: strong typing, enforces good principles
- Eiffel: object oriented, advertises being "fun" and "easy to learn" while still maintaining strong guarantees about safety and reliability
