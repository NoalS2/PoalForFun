# PoalForFun
A project to work on with Paige for fun.

#Project Ideas
Simply a quick brainstorm of things I think I would find fun.
1. Instructional base code to teach algorithms.
2. A visual representation of a cool recursive solution for educational purposes.
3. An introduction to coding concepts, data structures, and algorithms for friends and family of computer scientists. 
4. A puzzle "game" where you balance trees given certain operations. 

I was just brainstorming some ideas that I think could be fun to work on together. For some reason they are all like, teaching coding concepts type projects because I guess that's where my brain is at tonight. But I don't really know what I think would be fun to work on, I just think it would be fun to work on something with you. But also I know you program literally all day for work so there may only be very specific kinds of personal projects that you would actually enjoy to work on in your free time. Anyway I did not spend too long thinking about this list so don't feel like if we did work on something it would need to be on their, I was just throwing out ideas for fun.
